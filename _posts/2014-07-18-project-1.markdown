description: 1st EP "New Jeans" asks the question of "good music" pursued by New Jeans.

It did not follow the familiar formula of standardized K-pop, and it was based on POP, but did not stick to specific styles. The members of New Jeans pursue sophisticated easy listening pop that can be heard anywhere.
